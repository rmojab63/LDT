\title{Creates an \code{X-Times-A-Year} Frequency}
\usage{
F_XTimesAYear(year, x, position)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Year of the observation.}

\item{x}{Number of the observation in each year. It should be a positive integer.}

\item{position}{Position of the current observation. It should be a positive integer. It cannot be larger than \code{x}.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'ldtf'. It is also a list with the following members:
\itemize{
\item \strong{class:} Determines the class of this frequency.
\item \strong{year:} Determines the \code{year}.
\item \strong{x:} Determines the value: \code{x}.
\item \strong{position:} Determines the \code{position}.
}
}
\description{
Use it to create a frequency for time-series data that occurs \code{x} times every year.
}
\details{
In order to use \code{\link{as.ldtf}} function for this type of frequency,
you need the following information:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Value String:} \code{"#:#"} (first # is the \code{year} and
the second # is the \code{position}; e.g., 2010:8/12 or 2010:10/10. Note that 2000:0/2 or 2000:13/12 are invalid.
\item \strong{Class String:} \code{"y#"} (the number is the value: \code{x})
}
}
\examples{

xty0 <- F_XTimesAYear(2020, 3, 1) # this frequency divides the year 2020 into 3 partitions and refers to the first partition.

xty_value_str <-  as.character(xty0) # this will be '2020:1'.
xty_class_str <- get.class.id(xty0) # this will be 'y3'.

xty_new <- as.ldtf("2021:24", "z24") # this frequency divides the year 2021 into 24 partitions and refers to the last partition.

\dontrun{
# Don't make the following mistakes:

xty_invalid <- F_XTimesAYear(2020, 3, 0)
xty_invalid <- F_XTimesAYear(2020, 24, 25)
xty_invalid <- as.ldtf("2021:13", "y12")
xty_invalid <- as.ldtf("2021:0", "y1")
xty_invalid <- as.ldtf("2021", "y1")
}
}
