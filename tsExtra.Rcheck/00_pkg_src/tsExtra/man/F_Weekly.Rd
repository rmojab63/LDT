\title{Creates a Weekly Frequency}
\usage{
F_Weekly(year, month, day)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Year of the observation. It should be a valid year as an integer.}

\item{month}{Month of the observation. It should be a valid month of year as an integer.}

\item{day}{Day of the observation which will determine the start of the week. It should be a valid day of month as an integer.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'ldtf'. It is also a list with the following members:
\itemize{
\item \strong{class:} Determines the class of this frequency.
\item \strong{year:} Determines the \code{year}.
\item \strong{month:} Determines the \code{month}.
\item \strong{day:} Determines the \code{day}.
}
}
\description{
Use it to create a frequency for time-series data that occurs weekly. We use first day of the week as the reference.
}
\details{
In order to use \code{\link{as.ldtf}} function for this type of frequency,
you need the following information:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Value String:} First day of the week in \code{"YYYYMMDD"} format.
\item \strong{Class String:} \code{"w"}
}
}
\examples{

w0 <- F_Weekly(2023, 1, 2) # This is 2/1/2023 which is Monday. Next observation belongs to 9/1/2023.

w0_value_str <-  as.character(w0) # this will be '20230102'.
w0_class_str <- get.class.id(w0) # this will be 'w'.

w_new <- as.ldtf("20230109", "w") # This is 9/1/2023.

\dontrun{
# Don't use invalid or unsupported dates:

w_invalid <- as.ldtf("1399109", "w") # this is a too old date and unsupported
w_invalid <- as.ldtf("20230132", "w") # invalid day in month
w_invalid <- as.ldtf("20231331", "w") # invalid month

}
}
