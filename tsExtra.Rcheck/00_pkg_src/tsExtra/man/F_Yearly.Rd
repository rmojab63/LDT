\title{Creates an Annual Frequency}
\usage{
F_Yearly(year)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Year of the observation}
}
\value{
An object of class 'ldtf'. It is also a list with the following members:
\itemize{
\item \strong{class:} Determines the class of this frequency.
\item \strong{year:} Determines the \code{year}.
}
}
\description{
Use it to create a frequency for time-series data that occurs annually.
}
\details{
In order to use \code{\link{as.ldtf}} function for this type of frequency,
you need the following information:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Value String:} \code{"#"} (the number is the \code{year})
\item \strong{Class String:} \code{"y"}
}
}
\examples{

y0 <- F_Yearly(2020) # this initializes a 'yearly' frequency

y0_value_str <-  as.character(y0) # this will be '2020'.
y0_class_str <- get.class.id(y0) # this will be 'y'.

y_new <- as.ldtf("2021", "y") # this is a yearly frequency. It points to year 2021.

}
