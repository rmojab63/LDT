\title{Creates an \code{X-Times-Z-Years} Frequency}
\usage{
F_XTimesZYears(year, x, z, position)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Year of the observation.}

\item{x}{Number of partitions in each \code{z} years. It should be a positive integer.}

\item{z}{Number of years. It should be a positive integer.}

\item{position}{Position of the current observation. It should be a positive integer. It cannot be larger than \code{x}.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'ldtf'. It is also a list with the following members:
\itemize{
\item \strong{class:} Determines the class of this frequency.
\item \strong{year:} Determines the \code{year}.
\item \strong{z:} Determines the value: \code{z}.
\item \strong{x:} Determines the value: \code{x}.
\item \strong{position:} Determines the \code{position}.
}
}
\description{
Use it to create a frequency for time-series data that occurs \code{x} times every \code{z} years.
}
\details{
In order to use \code{\link{as.ldtf}} function for this type of frequency,
you need the following information:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Value String:} \code{"#:#"} (Similar to \code{X-Times-A-Year}. Note that the string representation refers to the first year of the interval.)
\item \strong{Class String:} \code{"x#z#"} (first '#' is the value: \code{x},
second '#' is the value: \code{z}; e.g., x23z4 means 23 times every 4 years)
}
}
\examples{

xtzy0 <- F_XTimesZYears(2020, 3, 2, 3) # this frequency divides the year 2020 into 3 partitions and refers to the last partition. The next observation belongs to 2022 (not the next year).

xtzy_value_str <-  as.character(xtzy0) # this will be '2020:3'.
xtzy_class_str <- get.class.id(xtzy0) # this will be 'x3z2'.

xtzy_new <- as.ldtf("2021:3", "x3z4") # this frequency divides the year 2021 into 3 partitions and refers to the last partition. The next observation occurs after 4 years.

\dontrun{
# Don't make the following mistakes:

xtzy_invalid <- F_XTimesZYears(2020, 3, 5, 0)
xtzy_invalid <- F_XTimesZYears(2020, 3, 0, 1)
xtzy_invalid <- as.ldtf("2021:25", "x24y2")
}
}
