\title{Creates an \code{Daily-In-Week} Frequency}
\usage{
F_DailyInWeek(
  year,
  month,
  day,
  weekStart = "mon",
  weekEnd = "fri",
  forward = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Year of the observation. It should be a valid year as an integer.}

\item{month}{Month of the observation. It should be a valid month of year as an integer.}

\item{day}{Day of the observation which will determine the start of the week. It should be a valid day of month as an integer.}

\item{weekStart}{First day of the week. It can be \code{sun}, \code{mon}, \code{tue}, \code{wed}, \code{thu}, \code{fri}, and \code{sat}.}

\item{weekEnd}{Last day of the week. See \code{weekStart} for possible values. Together, they define the week}

\item{forward}{If the current date is not in the week and this value is true, it moves forward to the first day of the week. If this value is false, it moves backward to the last day of the week.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'ldtf'. It is also a list with the following members:
\itemize{
\item \strong{class:} Determines the class of this frequency.
\item \strong{year:} Determines the \code{year}.
\item \strong{month:} Determines the \code{month}.
\item \strong{day:} Determines the \code{day}.
\item \strong{weekStart:} Determines the \code{weekStart}.
\item \strong{weekEnd:} Determines the \code{weekEnd}.
}
}
\description{
Use it to create a frequency for time-series data that occurs daily within a subset of a week. The first day of the interval is used as the reference.
}
\details{
In order to use \code{\link{as.ldtf}} function for this type of frequency,
you need the following information:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Value String:} \code{"YYYYMMDD"} (First day of the interval in \code{"YYYYMMDD"} format.)
\item \strong{Class String:} \code{"i:...-..."} (the first '...' is \code{weekStart} and the second '...' is \code{weekEnd}; e.g., \code{i:mon-fri} means a week from Monday to Friday)
}
}
\examples{

dw0 <- F_DailyInWeek(2023, 5, 16, "mon", "fri") # This is 16/5/2023.
dw0_value_str <-  as.character(dw0) # this will be '20230516'.
dw0_class_str <- get.class.id(dw0) # this will be 'i:mon-fri'.

# Let's use the same date with another week definition:
dw1 <- F_DailyInWeek(2023, 5, 16, "wed", "sat") # This is NOT 16/5/2023. It is 17/5/2023. Since it was outside the week, we moved it forward.
dw2 <- F_DailyInWeek(2023, 5, 16, "wed", "sat", FALSE) # This is 13/5/2023. The original day was outside the week, but we moved backward too the end of the previous week (which is Saturday).

dw_new <- as.ldtf("20230519", "i:sat-wed") # This is 20/1/2023 (by default, it moves forward).

\dontrun{
# Don't use invalid or unsupported dates.

dw_invalid <- as.ldtf("1399109", "d3") # this is a too old date and unsupported
dw_invalid <- as.ldtf("20230132", "d4") # invalid day in month
dw_invalid <- as.ldtf("20231331", "d5") # invalid month

# don't use invalid week definitions:
F_DailyInWeek(2023, 5, 16, "Wednesday", "sat")
