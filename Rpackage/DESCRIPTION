The L-BFGS-B algorithm was written in the 1990s (mainly 1994, some revisions 1996) by Ciyou Zhu (in collaboration with R.H. Byrd, P. Lu-Chen and J. Nocedal). L-BFGS-B Version 3.0 is an algorithmic update from 2011, with coding changes by J. L. Morales"))
Description: Methods and tools for model selection and multi-model inference (Burnham and Anderson (2002) <doi:10.1007/b97636>, among others). 
             'SUR' (for parameter estimation), 'logit'/'probit' (for binary classification), and 'VARMA' (for time-series forecasting) are implemented.
             Evaluations are both in-sample and out-of-sample. 
             It is designed to be efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption.
