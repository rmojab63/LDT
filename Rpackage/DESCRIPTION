Description: Methods and tools for creating a model set and estimating and evaluating the explanation or prediction power of its members. 
             'SUR' modelling (for parameter estimation), 'logit'/'probit' modelling (for binary classification), and 'VARMA' modelling (for time-series forecasting) are implemented.
             Evaluations are both in-sample and out-of-sample.
             It can be used for stepwise regression analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression>, 
             automatic model selection and model averaging (Claeskens and Hjort (2008, ISBN:1139471805, 9781139471800)), 
             calculating benchmarks, and doing sensitivity analysis (Leamer (1983) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803924> proposal).
