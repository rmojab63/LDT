The L-BFGS-B algorithm was written in the 1990s (mainly 1994, some revisions 1996) by Ciyou Zhu (in collaboration with R.H. Byrd, P. Lu-Chen and J. Nocedal). L-BFGS-B Version 3.0 is an algorithmic update from 2011, with coding changes by J. L. Morales"))
Description: Methods and tools for creating a model set and estimating and evaluating the explanation or prediction power of its members. 
             'SUR' modelling (for parameter estimation), 'logit'/'probit' modelling (for binary classification), and 'VARMA' modelling (for time-series forecasting) are implemented.
             Evaluations are both in-sample and out-of-sample. It tries to be both CPU and memory efficient.
             This package can be applied to perform sensitivity analysis in studies involving regression analysis.
             It can also be utilized for automatic model selection, multi-model inference, and model averaging within a frequentist framework (Claeskens and Hjort (2008, ISBN:1139471805, 9781139471800)), 
             calculating benchmarks, and extreme bound analysis (Leamer (1983) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803924>).
